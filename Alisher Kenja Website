			<h2>Intrest In IT</h2>
		</div>


			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<p>
						I think my interest in IT peaked with my IST teacher (Information and Software Technology Class), he is by far my favorite teacher and he is a close family friend too, he taught me everything I know about coding, making games, building websites, Graphical technology (Using AutoCad, Fusion360, Adobe) and even about this course so I like to think of him as family and I am very lucky to have him. I felt that he was the one to spark my interest in IT.
					</p>
					<p>
						I chose to enter this course in RMIT because I enjoy these things, I believe that I can make this a hobby and a job while loving every part of it. I believe that technology has many advantages and it can help people like me get a headstart and do something I enjoy while making time to do other things and make a living. RMIT will help me get that head start and will help me pave the way to implementing what I like and do best into my future, It will help me as it has active teachers, and well founded resources, and I believe it has extensive questions and responses to help solve any inquiries.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my studies during this course i expect to learn what IT is and how to apply that knowledge in the real world my making either a game or a product with the help of my teacher, I expect t learn how to work collaboratively, effectively and creatively learning about my peers and teacher while learning about technological innovations.

			<h3>Myers Briggs Test</h3>
		</div>


			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<p>
						What do the results of these tests mean to you?
					</p>
					</p>
						This test result reimagined what I know about myself, it is reassuring knowing that I am not someone I myself don't know. I am surprised at how accurate I think this quiz is, the visuals through the well made website and well designed reference photos really add to the experience of knowing how you are that person.
					</p>

						“I wanted to live the life, a different life. I didn’t want to go to the same place every day and see the same people and do the same job. I wanted interesting challenges.” HARRISON FORD
					</p>
					<p>
						How do you think these results may influence your behaviour on a team?
					</p>
					<p>
						I feel more reassured and it helped me look at my strengths and weaknesses through a different perspective. It is a different experience having all your strengths and weaknesses written in front of you by someone else, It makes me feel more understood and it showed me how I could really make an impact on any team with my given skill sets.
					</p>
					<p>
						How should you take this into account when forming a team?
					</p>
					<p>
						As a Virtuoso I can offer any team my creativity, I would help my team in any way possible, I can be flexible and a great social worker, I would offer every ounce of strength and time for a team but I sometimes need someone to put me in check as I get sidetracked easily, I would form a team of people who can cover each other's weaknesses and whom strengths we can use but anyone is welcome too.

			<h3>Online Learning Style Test</h3>

				<article>
					<p>
						http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=5&V=4&T=11
					</p>
					<p>
						What do the results of these tests mean to you?
					</p>
					<p>
						The results of this test tells me that I am a tactile learner, I enjoy learning new things by touching and doing while taking frequent breaks. The test tells me that I love physical activity and have trouble sitting still while tinkering with things. I found that this test was accurate too but while not as accurate as the other tests it told me things that the other tests didn't tell me like athletic ability.
					</p>
					<p>
						How do you think these results may influence your behaviour on a team?
					</p>
					<p>
						I may be more of a hard worker while also taking many tests to break away from work and society. I will probably be away most days doing outdoor activities and staying with close friends, but I will always make time for work and keep things on task.
					</p>
					<p>
						How should you take this into account when forming a team?
					</p>
					<p>
						I would choose a team that can work with a person like me or join a team that can benefit from my available skillset like people who are leaders, or can spend a lot of time working while I cant but I am not too picky and I am happy to join any team as long as we all stay within good terms of each other.

			<h3>Creativity Test</h3>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<p>
						What do the results of these tests mean to you?
					</p>
					<p>
						In this test I am on the brink of unlocking my creative mind, To me this means that i would be a good team worker as i have something to give a team and to help any team and it’s team members making me a good teammate.
					</p>
					<p>
						How should you take this into account when forming a team?
					</p>
					<p>
						I would do my part in any team and would be a social worker, I would do my best for a team and would make sure to have fun too, although I do some difficulty concentrating I would split my time between rest and work so I can get the most done while also taking time off. I would make a team that fits together and works together while also covering each other weaknesses and working with strengths.
